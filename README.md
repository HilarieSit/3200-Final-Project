Run leastsquaresfit.m first to fit the spring and damping force data. </br>
Run simulation.m to solve system of ODEs with 4th order Runge-Kutta and forward Euler. Note that there are two dydtsys files: dydtsys10 (for V = 10 km/hr) and dydtsys40 (for V = 40 km/hr). Other than the difference in V value, both dydtsys files are the exact same. </br>
